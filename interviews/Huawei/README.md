# First Round

## Q1

For all prime numbers in the range [low, high), we calculate the sum of the units digits and the tens digitt. Output the smaller oneã€‚

Example:

    input: 151 158
    output: 8
    explanation:
    The prime numbers are 151 and 157. Thus, the tens digit is 5+5=10, units digit is 1+7=8
    
The only trick is that both low and high can be pretty large! Thus, I used `unsigned long long` for all integers involved in the code.    
    
## Q2

Given an string, convert all capital letter to small letter, and conver space to 0.

The only trick is that this string contains space. 
Thus we need to use `getline(cin, input)` instead of regular `cin>>input`.
