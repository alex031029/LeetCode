Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

    Input: [1,2,3]
        1
       / \
      2   3
    Output: 25
    Explanation:
    The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
    The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
    Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
Example 2:

    Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
        4
       / \
      9   0
     / \
    5   1
    Output: 1026
    Explanation:
    The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
    The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
    The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
    Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
