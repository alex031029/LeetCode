Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

    Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7
    return its depth = 3.
