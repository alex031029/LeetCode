The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:

    Input: 4
    Output: [
     [".Q..",  // Solution 1
      "...Q",
      "Q...",
      "..Q."],

     ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
      "Q...",
      "...Q",
      ".Q.."]
    ]
    Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
