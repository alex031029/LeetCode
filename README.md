# LeetCode and HackerRank

I sync some (not all) LeetCode and HackerRank questions I have done into this repo. 

**Possible answer files:**

* answer.cpp: a normal accepted answer with at least not bad time complexity 
* answer_slow.cpp: an accepted answer with either a theoretically or pratically slow performance
* answer_high_space.cpp: an accepted answer with large space consumption
* answer_TLE.cpp: a correct implementation, but it exceeds LeetCode time limit
* answer_wrong.cpp: a wrong answer. 
  Usually it contains some logical faults that can hardly be refined trivially. 
  I'd like to remind me of these logical faults in the code
