# LeetCode and HackerRank

I sync some (not all) LeetCode and HackerRank questions I have done into this repo. 

possible answer files:

* answer.cpp: normal accepted answer with at least not bad time complexity 
* answer_slow.cpp: an accepted answer with either a theoretically or pratically slow performance
* answer_high_space.cpp: an accepted answer with large space consumption
* answer_TLE.cpp: a correct implementation, but it exceeds LeetCode time limit
* answer_wrong.cpp: a wrong answer. I'd like to remind me of some logical faults in this code
