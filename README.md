# LeetCode and HackerRank

I sync some (not all) LeetCode and HackerRank questions I have done into this repo. 

I mainly implement questions in C++. In rare cases, I do code it in C, which happens when I think stl is not necessary in these particular question. 

In addition, as I am practicing Java and C#, I am also trying to answer some questions in these two languages. Just bare my naive Java and C# implementaion.

**Possible answer files:**

* `answer.cpp`: a normal accepted answer with at least not bad time complexity 
* `answer_slow.cpp`: an accepted answer with either a theoretically or pratically slow performance
* `answer_high_space.cpp`: an accepted answer with large space consumption
* `answer_TLE.cpp`: a correct implementation, but it exceeds LeetCode time limit
* `answer_wrong.cpp`: a wrong answer. 
  Usually it contains some logical faults that can hardly be refined trivially. 
  I'd like to remind me of these logical faults in the code
