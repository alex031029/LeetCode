# LeetCode and HackerRank

This repo syncs question that I have done in LeetCode and HackerRank questions.

I mainly answer questions in C++. In rare cases, I do code it in C, which happens when I think STL is not necessary in these particular questions. 

In addition, as I am practicing Java and C#, I am also trying to answer some questions in these two languages. Just bare my naive Java and C# implementaion.

**Possible Answer Files:**

* `answer.cpp`: a normal accepted answer with at least not bad time complexity.
* `answer_slow.cpp`: an accepted answer with either a theoretically or pratically slow performance.
* `answer_high_space.cpp`: an accepted answer with large space consumption.
* `answer_TLE.cpp`: a theoretically correct implementation, but it exceeds LeetCode time limit.
* `answer_wrong.cpp`: a wrong answer. 
  Usually it contains some logical faults that can hardly be refined trivially. 
  I'd like to remind me of these logical faults in the code.
