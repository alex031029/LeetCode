Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

    Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

    One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

          0
         / \
       -3   9
       /   /
     -10  5
