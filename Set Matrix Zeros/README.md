Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place.

Example 1:

    Input: 
    [
      [1,1,1],
      [1,0,1],
      [1,1,1]
    ]
    Output: 
    [
      [1,0,1],
      [0,0,0],
      [1,0,1]
    ]
Example 2:

    Input: 
    [
      [0,1,2,0],
      [3,4,5,2],
      [1,3,1,5]
    ]
    Output: 
    [
      [0,0,0,0],
      [0,4,5,0],
      [0,3,1,0]
    ]
Follow up:

* A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
* A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
* Could you devise a constant space solution?
