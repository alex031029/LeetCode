Given an image represented by an N x N matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

 

Example 1:

    Given matrix = 
    [
      [1,2,3],
      [4,5,6],
      [7,8,9]
    ],

    Rotate the matrix in place. It becomes:
    [
      [7,4,1],
      [8,5,2],
      [9,6,3]
    ]

Example 2:

    Given matrix =
    [
      [ 5, 1, 9,11],
      [ 2, 4, 8,10],
      [13, 3, 6, 7],
      [15,14,12,16]
    ], 

    Rotate the matrix in place. It becomes:
    [
      [15,13, 2, 5],
      [14, 3, 4, 1],
      [12, 6, 8, 9],
      [16, 7,10,11]
    ]
