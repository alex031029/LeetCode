Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

    Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

          5
         / \
        4   8
       /   / \
      11  13  4
     /  \      \
    7    2      1
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
