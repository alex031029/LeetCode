Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

    Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
    Output: 2
Example 2:

    Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
    Output: 3
Note:

* You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
* You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
* Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
* There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
