# Trikcy Cases for answer.cpp

## Case 1

    [["0","0","0","1"],
    ["1","1","0","1"],
    ["1","1","1","1"],
    ["0","1","1","1"],
    ["0","1","1","1"]]
    
    
## Case 2:

    
    [["0","1","1","0","0","1","1"],
    ["1","1","1","0","1","1","1"],
    ["0","1","1","1","1","1","0"],
    ["0","1","1","1","1","1","0"],
    ["0","0","1","1","1","1","1"]]
    
Both cases were for lines


    if(matrix[i][j-1-t]!='1'||matrix[i-1-t][j]!='1')
    {
        dp[i][j] = t+1;
        break;
    }
    
where case 1 is for `dp[i][j] = t+1;`, and case 2 is for `break;`
