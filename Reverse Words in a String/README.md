Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

 

Example 1:

    Input: "the sky is blue"
    Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

    Input: "  hello world!  "
    Output: "world! hello"
    Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:

    Input: "a good   example"
    Output: "example good a"
    Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.


Note:

* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
