Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Example 1:

    Input:
    matrix = [
      [1,   3,  5,  7],
      [10, 11, 16, 20],
      [23, 30, 34, 50]
    ]
    target = 3
    Output: true
Example 2:

    Input:
    matrix = [
      [1,   3,  5,  7],
      [10, 11, 16, 20],
      [23, 30, 34, 50]
    ]
    target = 13
    Output: false
