There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

    Example 1:

    nums1 = [1, 3]
    nums2 = [2]

    The median is 2.0
Example 2:

    nums1 = [1, 2]
    nums2 = [3, 4]

    The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
