Given a list of words, we may encode it by writing a reference string S and a list of indexes A.

For example, if the list of words is ["time", "me", "bell"], we can write it as S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].

Then for each index, we will recover the word by reading from the reference string from that index until we reach a "#" character.

What is the length of the shortest reference string S possible that encodes the given words?

Example:

    Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
    Output: 10
    Explanation: S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].


Note:

* 1 <= words.length <= 2000.
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 7.
* Each word has only lowercase letters.
