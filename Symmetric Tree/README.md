Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

        1
       / \
      2   2
     / \ / \
    3  4 4  3


But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

        1
       / \
      2   2
       \   \
       3    3


Note:

Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
