Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Example 1:

    Input: [1,2,3]

           1
          / \
         2   3

    Output: 6
Example 2:

    Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

       -10
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7

Output: 42
